              You might feel like you’re stuck in a rut in your daily life. Or
              you’re yearning for something exciting and different. You’re
              craving new experiences and new challenges. Travel is the ideal
              place to test yourself. It pushes people to their limits and gets
              them outside their comfort zone. You’ll discover how resourceful
              you are when you’re exposed to new places, people and experiences.
              Maybe it’s finding your way around a busy city. Or ordering a meal
              when you don’t speak the language. Or zip-lining. You’ll feel
              pride when you finish your trip successfully. Overcoming
              challenges will bring you joy and energy for future tests. You’ll
              realize how capable you are and build your confidence.

              Learning is a strong reasons/reason why people love to travel.
              They want to experience something unfamiliar and leave with new
              skills or knowledge. Seeing the world is more educational than a
              high school or college class. This condensed crash course in
              discovering how the rest of the world lives actually will cover
              subjects like history, geography and sociology. Every destination
              has something unique to teach visitors, and immersing themselves
              in a completely different world is the best learning experience.

              Travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see,
              taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to
              adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with
              different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share
              new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.
              Whether you seek adrenaline and non-stop activity, or unapologetic
              siestas and ultimate relaxation, travel gives us the opportunity
              to explore with an open heart and an open mind.

              Our lives are time-starved and technology-driven and, let’s be
              honest, it’s not often that we actually take the necessary time to
              de-stress and truly switch off. Travel allows us to escape life’s
              daily demands, dramas and deadlines and enables us to clear our
              minds. It encourages us to recharge our batteries and to truly
              disconnect (from our phones, Wi-Fi, emails, laptops, social media,
              etc.) in order to reconnect (with ourselves, each other and the
              natural environment).

              Some of my most cherished memories are from the times when I was
              travelling. If you travel, you can experience things that you
              could never experience at home. You may see beautiful places and
              landscapes that do not exist where you live. You may meet people
              that will change your life, and your thingking. You may try
              activities that you have never tried before.
