                New Zealand's South Island brims with majestic landscapes at
                every turn, from dramatic mountains to spectacular fjords. Here,
                you can admire the mountains of Fiordland National Park, a
                UNESCO World Heritage Site, from hiking trails or a boat on
                Milford Sound. At night, journey to the University of
                Canterbury's Mount John Observatory to gaze at the starry skies.
                You can also indulge your inner daredevil in Queenstown (a
                favorite destination among bungee jumpers), sample delicious
                sauvignon blanc wine in the Marlborough region or explore New
                Zealand's most accessible glaciers – Franz Josef and Fox Glacier
                – on the island's west coast.

                The magnetic City of Light draws visitors from around the globe
                who come to see iconic attractions like the Eiffel Tower, the
                Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe. But what travelers really fall
                in love with are the city's quaint cafes, vibrant markets,
                trendy shopping districts and unmistakable je ne sais quoi. Get
                lost wandering along the charming cobblestone streets, or grab a
                croissant and relax on the banks of the Seine for hours. If
                you're up for a quick daytrip, head about 15 miles southwest of
                the city center to the Palace of Versailles, which offers guided
                and self-guided tours of the estate.

                Whether you're driving along the Road to Hana, enjoying a
                bird's-eye view of Maui's lush coastline from a helicopter,
                snorkeling with sea turtles or simply relaxing on white or black
                sand beaches, you'll find that this Hawaiian island is unlike
                any other tropical destination. Don't miss a chance to visit
                Haleakala National Park, which is home to one of the world's
                largest dormant volcanic craters. You should also attend a luau
                for a dose of local culture and a taste of Hawaiian specialties
                like poi, poke and mahimahi.

                What this small French Polynesian island may lack in size it
                makes up for in sheer tropical beauty. Here, you'll find
                picturesque beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts. The
                island's extinct volcano, Mount Otemanu, makes for a great
                photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals
                can help you catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during
                an off-road excursion. To relax, head to Matira Beach for
                crystal-clear water and soft white sand. Although a trip to Bora
                Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth every
                penny.

                Travel to this island – the largest in French Polynesia – if
                you've been dreaming of a vacation spent lazing in a lavish
                overwater bungalow. Beyond the posh resorts, Tahiti boasts black
                sand and golden beaches, a bustling capital and prime snorkeling
                and surfing conditions. If you're looking for more cultural
                experiences, check out some of the island's ancient temples or
                shop at its traditional indoor markets. To save money, opt to
                stay in a vacation rental – the island is home to plenty of cute
                bungalows and chic condos.
