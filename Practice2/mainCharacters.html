            Thomas, originally named Stephen, is the last male Glader and one of the creators of the Maze alongside Teresa Agnes. He is the protagonist of the series and presumably named after Thomas Edison. <br>

            Newt is the Second-in-Command of the Gladers. He has long blond hair and a heavy limp from attempting suicide when he was a Runner. He was taller than Alby, despite the one year age difference. Newt was named after Isaac Newton. He is described as having an "odd accent," and Dashner has said he thought of him as being either English or Scottish. <br>

            Assistant Director Janson (A.D Janson), also referred to as Rat Man (given to him by Minho), was the second highest-ranking official in the organization WICKED under Chancellor Paige. Thomas, who Janson states that "he had never seen someone more dedicated to finding a cure" about, trained Janson after the original Creators were purged. Janson is the main antagonist in both the book series, and in the movie series.
