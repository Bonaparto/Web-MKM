              Runners - are the only ones who are allowed to go out into the Maze. They are defined as the strongest and fastest of the Gladers. Runners run the Maze every day, trying to find a way out. The maps they make are saved in the Map Room. They leave when the Doors open in the morning and return right before the Doors close. The Keeper of the Runners is Minho.
